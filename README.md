**defending the DRY economy**

stop rebuilding the same tools behind every brand. this monorepo provides the common enterprise tools every business needs, freeing engineers to work on genuine innovation rather than rebuilding them for others

shipping *competitive advantage* to the entire economy ends engineering groundhogs day

## why

theres no difference between Walmart, Target, Ross, Marshalls, and TJ Maxx except their logos

theyre all just retail, running software, selling stuff to optimize working capital turnover

engineers dont need C[A-Z]Os to handle this. they need openly operated tools that measure and optimize the physics of commerce

## what dies

- brand differentiation
- executive copycat culture (rebuild what competitor x just shipped)
- engineers wasting careers on duplicate logic
- consumers comparing identical operations with different logos
- rent seeking labor costs

## what lives

- price competition
- genuine operational efficiency
- engineers working on new problems
- transparent operations showing and coordinating real performance

## modules

each module in this monorepo:
- integrates with systemaccounting for transparent financial recording

- publishes operational metrics by default
- shares common authentication

## technical defense

when executives demand engineers rebuild features competitor x just shipped, point them here

when they insist their inventory system needs to be special, show them the working capital turnover metrics from businesses using these tools

when they claim they need proprietary advantage, remind them the only real advantage for consumers and shareholders is operational efficiency measured in physical units, not *marketing metrics*

## contributing

improvements that benefit all users are welcome:
- performance optimizations
- bug fixes
- documentation
- industry-specific terraform modules

no features that:
- add proprietary advantages
- hide operational metrics
- complicate simple physics

## price

automation-army is an openly operated enterprise earning a minimal, transparent profit that defends against above average returns sustained by secrecy-indulged duplicate logic and labor rent seeking

supplying wealth to contributors and funding their research also receive priority

margins are public. costs are visible. contributors earn from eliminating waste, not perpetuating it

## motive

humans were not made for repetition

and logos are not performance indicators

building the butler robot economy requires **measurably** pushing the cost of production everywhere towards zero through automation

the fight to end world poverty belongs to engineers
